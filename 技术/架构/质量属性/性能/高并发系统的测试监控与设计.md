### 性能指标

#### CPU使用率

Below are some of the top  reasons why java apps may conssume abnormal amount of CPU resource:

- Poorly designed applications that do not properly handle resources like databases and storage systems can cause CPU utilization to skyrocket.
- Too many recursive method calls can overload the call stack.
- When complex data objects like Collections are handled inefficiently, their overhead can quickly pile up across hundreds or thousands of iterations.
- Sometimes, inefficient memory management in your Java app can force the JVM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine to run garbage collection more often than usual, which can hog CPU usage.
- Threads are often the cause of bad CPU resource management since their lifecycle is often not managed properly in the source code, among other reasons.
