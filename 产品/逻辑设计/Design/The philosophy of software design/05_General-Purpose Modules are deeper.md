# General-Purpose Modules are deeper

The module's functionality should reflect your currents needs, but its intefarce should not. Instead the interface should be general enough to support multiple uses.



Question to ask yourself.

1. What is the simplest interface that will cover all my current needs?
2. In how many situations will this method be used?
   1. Is this API easy to use for my current needs.



Making your modules somewhat general-purpose is one of the best way to reduce overall system complexity.
